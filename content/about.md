- A multi stakeholder platform cooperative.
- Open source, owned and managed by all active participants, from local consumers to regional wholesalers.

Shiro moves beyond food as a commodity and people as consumers. Participation on the platform means an active food citizenship to support the development of a democratic, socially and economically just, and environmentally regenerative food system.

## Shiro builds a new food system from the bottom up, not top down!

 Local first, region and city second, national and international where possible.

- Scaling out, not scaling up!
- Rejuvenating communities, creating thousands of jobs.
- Eliminating middlemen to achieve affordable food for consumers and increased profitability for producers.
- A local economy where value is circulated rather than extracted. Locally created value stays local!


## Shiro bridges the gap between producers and consumers.

- Connects supply and demand.
- Matches existing offers with consumer needs and wants.
- Unlocks value and stimulates creation of new business models through a continuous loop of supply/demand discovery and co-creation.


## A multi sided matching engine at the core.

Built using the [ValueFlows](https://valueflo.ws) vocabularies for distributed economic networks where resources flow from agent to agent to agent via events. Objects such as resources, events, agents, proposals, intentions, actions, commitments and processes can be combined in novel configurations to facilitate a multitude of business scenarios.

Supports new business models as well as established:
- Direct sales (store, webshop)
- Community Suppported Agriculture (subscriptions)
- Buyers clubs (group ordering)etc.

## Built on [Holochain](https://holochain.org), the next generation application platform.

Holochain is an open-source development framework and networking protocol. It allows for truly serverless applications with high levels of security, reliability, and performance. Holochain is modular, resilient and encrypted by design, handles value and transactions securely like a blockchain but without the scaling issues.
